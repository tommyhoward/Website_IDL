    <h1>My Essay on Perogies</h1>

    <p>When I think of a perfect day with my family, Perogies always finish that day off. Perogies are a type of food-filled dumpling from Eastern Europe, most famously associated with Polish cuisine, typically filled with potatoes, cheese, and sometimes other meats, such as bacon or pork. They taste savory from the meat and sweet from the onions, making a perfect mix. Perogies are also known to be served with kielbasa, a type of sausage.</p>

    <p>The Polish and most well-known Pierogi are usually made in a cast-iron pan and cooked very crispy. But the way I cook it is the Slovak way. We boil the Perogies in a pot of water for about five minutes or until they float to the top of the pot of water. Then we immediately move them to a pan filled with two sticks of brown butter, and fry until they turn golden brown. Once they're fully cooked, we put them in a large bowl filled with sliced brown onions. We cook the brown onions for about 30 minutes before I start cooking the pierogi. This blend of sweet and savory creates the perfect comfort food.</p>

    <p>It's a very long, focused process to cook them, but the warm, sweet, and savory flavor is most definitely worth it. Perogies have been in my family for many generations. They are a celebratory food for us, and we share them with all of our family and friends. My mom remembers her parents and grandparents making her pierogi for Christmas. The last time I saw my family was during the reunion that takes place in Florida every Easter, and my grandmother made pierogi for my cousins and me, which ended the vacation with an amazing feeling of home and warmth.</p>

    <p>I remember one time a few years ago when I was really sick for a few days. I woke up to a blaring headache, a clogged nose, and a lack of appetite. But then I smelt the warm, buttery scent of my mom’s Perogies seep into my room! In an instant, my afflictions deserted me like they weren’t even there to begin with, my once empty stomach now grumbled what those incredible smelling Perogies would taste like. As I raced out to see my family around a dinner table, filled with pierogi and kielbasa, the sad, sick side of my body was suddenly filled with joy and happiness. From this memory, I learned one thing: no matter how bad I feel, my favorite food will always overpower those sad emotions.</p>

    <p>Perogies' origin is debated but generally considered to be from 13th-century Poland, possibly introduced by Saint Hyacinth from Kiev, or linked to Chinese dumplings via the Silk Road or Marco Polo. A popular Polish legend attributes their creation to Saint Hyacinth, who supposedly used dumplings to feed people during a famine. The dish became a national staple and evolved into a versatile food, featured in the first Polish cookbook in 1682, and later adapted with ingredients like potatoes and cheese from the Americas. While pierogi are a national dish in Poland with origins potentially in the 13th-century Asia, they are a staple in other Eastern and Central European countries, including Slovakia, where they are known as pirohy.</p>

    <p>I want to be able to cook pierogi anytime for all my friends and family when I get older, especially for or with my mother, because she's the one who's been making all of the pierogi for me throughout my life, and I want to pay that back to her by making her the pierogi.</p>

    <p>What most people don’t know about pierogi is that they were a common meal used by immigrants during long and arduous journeys. Perogies are extremely filling and could feed large families at a time, making them a popular dish amongst Irish and Slovak immigrants in search of a new life, a new light. During these tough times, hope was often depleted, but nothing could bring a stronger warmth than being with your family while eating delicious food. To these dedicated travelers, perogies were more than just food; they were a new light in harsh times.</p>

    <p>Now it’s important to realize that Perogies aren’t just for the enjoyment of family, but can also lead to new friendships. As some know, connecting with people who don’t have any shared interests can be a difficult challenge, especially if they are difficult people. But nothing connects people like the mutual love for good food. Perhaps it was an evolutionary instinct to feel more connected to those who share your food, maybe it's the way eating food with others is a naturally great icebreaker. Either way, nothing builds stronger friendships like sharing the enjoyment of perogies. That's why they're called taste-buds and not taste-strangers!</p>

    <p>The flavor-packed perogies have a long history found in many cultures. My personal history with perogies is filled with love, warmth, and great memories. Outside my family, perogies have done many things for others, from helping immigrants survive harsh journeys to bringing strangers into friends. Perogies continue to impact the world and spread happiness. They’re my favorite food for a lot more than just the taste.</p>
